    <h2>The Brief</h2>
    <p>This week you are being assigned <strong>The Brief</strong>, a.k.a a test plan.</p>
    <img src="./keyboard_files/tremors.jpg" alt="Screenshot from the excellent Kevin Bacon movie &#39;Tremors&#39;, wherein Fred Ward is assuring us that there is a plan.">
</section>
<section>
    <p>This is your 2nd major assignment, due <strong>June 1<sup>st</sup></strong> (2 weeks from&nbsp;now).</p>
    <p>Your final assignment will eventually be to <strong>do usability testing</strong> and <strong>report your findings</strong>. This assignment, the Brief, is your <strong>plan for that testing</strong>.</p>
    <p>The Brief, and the Final are both <strong>individual assignments</strong>, written by you and only by you. That said, you're welcome to help each other out with the <strong>actual testing</strong> - pool your participants, take notes for one another, etc. Testing is usually a team effort.</p>
    <p>Today we'll learn <strong>what goes in that plan</strong>, and why.</p>
</section>
<div class="body-spacer--small"></div>
<section>
    <h3 class="text-center">The thing you're testing</h3>
    <p>The <em>thing</em> you are testing is <strong>up to you</strong>.</p> 
    <p class="callout"><strong>However</strong> I strongly recommend you test something <em>you are building/have built</em>, as you will <strong>gain insights into your own assumptions</strong> about the user - although it might be cool to swap with a partner.</p>
</section>
<div class="body-spacer--small"></div>
<section>
    <h3 class="text-center">What <em>about</em> the thing is being tested? What are you not testing?</h3>
    <p>The <em>scope</em> of what you are testing is going to be partly pre-defined, and partially negotiable.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <h3 class="slide-only">Things I decide about your scope</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>You must <strong>test 5 people</strong>; either 5 classmates or 5 people outside the class, <strong>not a mix of the two</strong>.</li>
        <li>If testing your <strong>classmates</strong>, they must use a <strong>screenreader</strong> (which I'll show you how to use next week).</li>
        <li>If testing <strong>people outside the class</strong>, they must use <strong>only a keyboard</strong> (no mouse).</li>
        <li>As part of feedback on your brief, I will discuss with you whether your scope is too large (you're testing too many things).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What goes into a test plan?</h2>
    <p>The goal of a test plan is to <strong>convince people it's a good plan</strong>.</p>

    <p>In the workplace, a test plan is what you submit to get approval for the plan and/or buy-in from your team. You can always make adjustments to go above and beyond!</p>
    <p><strong>Everything that you write in your test plan needs to have a 'why' explained.</strong></p>

</section>
<section class="slide-only">
    <h3 class="text-center">Let's break some of these down</h3>
</section>
<div class="body-spacer--small"></div>
<section id="objective">
    <h3 class="text-center">Objective/Scope</h3>
    <p>You're probably not going to do a full, comprehensive usability test on a large website. You can <strong>test a set of features</strong>, or you can <strong>test for a set of issues</strong>. Define <strong>what these are</strong> and <strong>why you're investigating</strong> them.</p>
</section>
<div class="body-spacer--small"></div>
<section>
    <h3 class="text-center">Questions</h3>
    <p>Can users find <em>X</em>? Does <em>A</em> work better than <em>B</em>? Do users learn the interface in under <em>Y</em> amount of time?</p>
    <p>You need to explain what questions you're trying to answer, and <strong>why they matter</strong>.</p>
    <p class="post-only">A common analytics metric is the amount of time a user spends on a page. Why does this matter? <strong>It depends on the objectives of the site.</strong> Google wants users to spend a minimal amount of time on Google - it means the user has probably quickly found what they were looking for. The New York Times, on the other hand, wants users to spend a lot of time on their site, reading their content.</p>
    <p>When you define your questions, you must also explain <strong>why they are relevant</strong> to the product owner's interests.</p>
</section>
<section id="participants">
    <h3 class="text-center">Participants: Some magic numbers</h3>
    <p>What are the demographics of people you're testing? How many people are you testing?</p>
    <p>Jakob Nielsen reports the <strong>ROI thresholds</strong> in different usability testing methods:</p>
    <table>
        <tbody><tr>
            <td>Quantitative</td>
            <td>&gt;20</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Card sorting</td>
            <td>&gt;15</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Eyetracking</td>
            <td>39</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Heuristics</td>
            <td>4 experts</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Qualitative</strong></td>
            <td><strong>5</strong></td>
        </tr>
    </tbody></table>
</section>
<section>
    <p>Again, remember the <strong>purpose of the test plan</strong> - to make the argument that <em>your</em> tests will yield results that matter. So why are you testing the people you're testing?</p>
    <p>Also note that you don't need to write down people's names - just some demographic information to distinguish them from one another.</p>
</section>
<section id="methods">
    <h3 class="text-center">Methods</h3>
    <p>Define your procedure, testing type, tools, and tasks.</p>
    <p>Make sure to include browser, screen-recording software, hardware and operating system details! These matter when trying to get good data.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <p>Testing types and tools include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>heuristics</strong> (don't forget to say which heuristics - as we learned, there are many different heuristic checklists),</li>
        <li><strong>eyetracking</strong> (not recommended - I haven't found a webcam-based eyetracking solution that wasn't super janky, and, as we'll see shortly, you need <strong>a lot</strong> of users for your data to hold up),</li>
        <li><strong>discovery</strong> (finding problems by observing users pursue loosely defined goals),</li>
        <li><strong>benchmark</strong> (testing out how well solutions perform),</li>
        <li><strong>moderated</strong>/<strong>unmoderated</strong> (are you talking the user through the test? or just leaving them alone and recording?)</li>
        <li><strong>remote</strong>/<strong>on-site</strong></li>

    </ul>
</section>
<section>
    <p class="callout">There are <em>so many</em> different kinds of tests out there <span class="slide-only">(including some in the notes I left out of the slides because I ran out of room!)</span>. Don't start planning with the test. Start by deciding <strong>what question you want answered</strong>, and then figure out how to answer it.</p>
</section>
<div class="body-spacer--small"></div>
<section id="metrics">
    <h3 class="text-center">Metrics</h3>
    <p>What is the <strong>data</strong> you'll be collecting? How should it be <strong>measured</strong>? How can you be sure it fully <strong>answers your questions</strong>?</p>
    <p>This is probably the <strong>most important part of your plan</strong>.</p>
</section>
<div class="body-spacer--small"></div>
<h3 class="text-center">Examples of metrics</h3>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Executive summary</strong>: the whole plan, summarized in a couple paragraphs. This should be the last thing you write.

Writing an introduction is fine, but don't call it a summary.</li>
    <li><strong>Schedule and location</strong>: Since you'll likely be doing this testing remotely, this probably isn't super important to have documented, <em>but</em> you'll need to figure this out at some point anyway.</li>
    <li><strong>Equipment</strong>: If you're using anything more elaborate than the items listed in the 'methods' section, you'll likely want to make note of it.</li>
    <li><strong>Scenarios</strong>: I only listed this as 'may want to include' (rather than 'must-have'), because not all testing types require scenarios. That being said <strong>I'm pretty darn sure you'll all want to write out your scenarios.</strong><p>As I'm sure you'll remember from last week, scenarios are the tasks &amp; goals that your users will try to complete.</p></li>

    <h2>To summarize:</h2>
    <p>On June 1<sup>st</sup>, you'll submit a written plan for testing some feature, or set of features - preferrably something you built.</p>
    <p>You can test 5 non-classmates while they use a keyboard (no mouse), or 5 classmates while they use a screenreader.</p>
    <p>The goal of the plan is to convince people that the plan will find out stuff that will make things better for users.</p>
    <p>You've got a lot of options for how to write your test plan, but this would be a good structure:</p>
</section>
<section>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Executive Summary</strong>: here's a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">summary</span> of everything in the plan</li>
        <li><strong>Objective</strong>: this is why we're testing</li>
        <li><strong>Scope</strong>: this is what we're testing and what we're not testing, both in terms of website features, and in terms of the data we're generating</li>
        <li><strong>Scenario</strong>: the goal a user would have when using the feature</li>
        <li><strong>Methods</strong>: we'll read to the user from the script (attached), asking them to complete the scenario, then record their screenshare. When they've completed, we'll ask them to complete the customized version of the System Usability Scale through Google Forms.</li>
        <li><strong>Metrics</strong>: critical error rate, non-critical error rate, time on task, SUS.</li>
        <li><strong>Equipment</strong>: what operating system and browser are each of the individual participants using during the test?</li>
    </ul>
</section>
<div class="body-spacer"></div>
<section id="keyboardControl">
    <h2>Learning to use the keyboard</h2>
    <p>Keyboard controls are key for accessibility - that's why I'm having you test non-classmate users (if that's who you decide to test) with the keyboard.</p>
    <p>Feel free to teach them if they don't know how!</p>
    <p>Also - the only form control that's not captured here are radio buttons - they can be a little unintuitive if you've never used them with a keyboard before.</p>

    <p>When creating a test plan, we must ask the right questions. The right questions can tell us how to improve things. In order to ask the right questions, you must first know <strong>who are you trying to improve things for.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Dark patterns test <em>really</em> well</strong>.</p>
    <p>Dark patterns could be in legacy code, they could be given to you to develop, or they could even come from you.</p>
    <p>This type of design happens because decisions are being made based on business metrics, not a focus on the user. Whether the company is malicious, or just lazy, doesn't really matter to the end user. But if you see this type of design happening regularly at your work, it might be time to look for a new job.</p>

    <p>You need to write your usability plan so that you <strong>justify all your choices to the product owner</strong>.</p>
    <p>On rare occasions, the product owner will have interests that won't be apparent to the user (for example, <em>Do customers notice if we move to cheaper hosting?</em>). If your product owner has interests that conflict with the user, you should run the other way.</p>

    <h3 class="text-center">You are biased (don't worry, everybody&nbsp;is)</h3>
    <p>This is an individual assignment. You will write your test plan alone. You will present your test results alone.</p>
    <p>I want you to consider <em>performing</em> the tests with a helper.</p>
    <p>You are not aware of everyone, and worse yet, you are not aware of yourself. <strong>You are not objective</strong>. That's ok.</p>

    <p>In “<a href="https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/handle/10919/26477" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Usability Problem Description and the Evaluator Effect in Usability Testing</a>” a study by Miranda G. Capra at Virginia Tech, she found that 44 usability practitioners’ evaluations reported problems that <strong>overlapped by only 22 percent</strong>.</p>
    <p>Confirmation bias is likely going to be your biggest issue to watch out for, in yourself and other members of your team. It can occur in <strong>planning</strong> (how you phrase your questions), <strong>testing</strong> (how you interact with a subject), and <strong>analysis</strong> (how you interpret the data).</p>

    <h3 class="text-center">You are less biased when you stick to the&nbsp;script</h3>
    <p>A key reason we write our test plan is for transparency. We need to make our work <strong>reviewable</strong> so that our <strong>unconscious biases can be recognized</strong>. The more we can script, the better.</p>
    <p>Steve Krug is one of the big names in usability, and he has given us a wonderful sample script to work from.

     <h2>Component of the Week: Links</h2>
     <p>Ah, the hyperlink: the core concept of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext">World Wide Web</a>.</p>
     <pre class=" language-html"><code class=" language-html"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>a</span> <span class="token attr-name">href</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>the internet<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>You're welcome.<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>a</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span></code></pre>
     <p>Simple and straightforward, but so ubiquitous and flexible as to invite abuse, and therefore, inaccessibility.</p>
     <p>As I'm sure you've heard, one of the cornerstones of accessibility is <strong>semantic markup</strong>. In other words, <em>use elements for their intended use</em>. We'll better understand the purpose of an anchor tag shortly.</p>
</section>
<section>
     <p>There are only a couple of accessibility mistakes you can make with an anchor tag, while still using it semantically.</p>
     <p>One mistake I made for years: <strong>the text of a link should not be a URL</strong>. Many popular screenreaders <em>will not allow the user to skip while it reads the text of a link</em>.</p>
     <pre class=" language-html"><code class=" language-html"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>a</span> <span class="token attr-name">href</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>guesswhat.co.uk<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>

You know what? Large volumes of text inside 
links are also not a great idea. We can't put long, 
rambling text in our links like we used to, 
but we have our ways. One trick is to tell 'em stories 
that don't go anywhere - like the time I caught the 
ferry over to Shelbyville. I needed a new heel for my 
shoe, so, I decided to go to Morganville, which is 
what they called Shelbyville in those days. So I tied 
an onion to my belt, which was the style at the time. 
Now, to take the ferry cost a nickel, and in those 
days, nickels had pictures of bumblebees on 'em. Give 
me five bees for a quarter, you'd say. Now where were 
we? Oh yeah: the important thing was I had an onion on 
my belt, which was the style at the time. They didn't 
have white onions because of the war. The only thing 
you could get was those big yellow ones...<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>a</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span></code></pre>
</section>
<section>
      <p>Another thing to keep in mind is that links are an <strong>in-page navigational tool</strong>. When using the keyboard to navigate a page, the user can hit the tab button to go to each interactive element in sequence. This means that if the context for a link comes before that link, people using screenreaders <strong>will have not context for that link</strong>. Stuff like this is really unhelpful:</p>
      <pre class=" language-html"><code class=" language-html"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>a</span> <span class="token attr-name">href</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>/somewhere-else<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>Read more<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>a</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span></code></pre>
</section>
<section>
      <p>That being said, just like with images, screenreaders will inform the user that what they're focussed on is a link, so it's <strong>redundant</strong> to tell them:</p>
      <pre class=" language-html"><code class=" language-html"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>a</span> <span class="token attr-name">href</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redundancy<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>

      <p>And finally, shifting a user into a new window or tab can be disorienting if you don't give them a heads-up.</p>

<p>If you have something that behaves like a link but for some very good, very important reason cannot be an anchor, you can use the 'role' attribute.</p>
<p>'role' is an ARIA attribute, which we'll dive much deeper into in the second half of the term but notice what it does here - when HTML isn't semantic, it provides the information that WOULD have come from the semantic element.</p>  </section>
